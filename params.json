{"name":"Meow","tagline":"some Rust testing and benchmarking stuff","body":"### Meow\r\nThis repository contains several things I've used for Rust testing.\r\n\r\n* Inside `src/strings/` there are some older tools, one of which relies on the lolcat bible for benchmarking.\r\n* At `src/testloop.rs` there's source for **testloop**, a tool for TDD in Rust.  Running the following gives you constant feedback when you change a `*.rs` file under the directory of the crate file given, for example, under `src/`:\r\n```sh\r\nmake\r\n./bin/testloop src/demo.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also got the beginnings of a presentation about this [here](slides/lightning-2013-12.md).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
